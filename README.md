# solar-system-condensation-public-
Using thermodynamic equilibrium to calculate the condensation of the early solar system

This program is written in Python and very user-friendly. It follows the theory of Grossman (1972) and Yoneda & Grossman (1995). Solar abundance data is taken from Lodders (2003). Thermodynamic data is from JANAF and Robie & Hemingway (1995).
